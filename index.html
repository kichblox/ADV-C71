            <p class="text-muted text-left">I visited on december 27 2021. The food there is very good and it is a very small little cafe.What lovely people and wonderful food. My husband and I sat at the counter in front of the kitchen, so we could see all that was going on with some of the people preparing and serving the food. It was a great experience. The food itself was so fresh and good. We both and the tomato bisque soup. He had half Reuben and I had the Monterrey Melt. Everything there is organic and locally grown. We split a piece of chocolate pie for dessert.

                The plants and flowers around the restaurant were inspiring, especially the kale. We loved looking at all the places where they make furniture, leather, pottery, fabric, cheese, the general store and the garden store.

                I wish we didn't live so far away. We look forward to a return visit.

            <p>Jantar Mantar is an open-air observatory and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is distinctive in that it houses the world’s largest sundial. Fourteen major geometric devices are found at the observatory that do everything from predicting eclipses to tracking the location of stars as the earth orbits around the sun.

                An interest in astronomy and some knowledge of solid geometry is helpful to fully appreciate this unique observatory built around 1728.</p>

            <p>Saw it today with my kids and they loved it.You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you’ll miss 40% of the fun.At minimum:Infinity WarCivil WarBlack PantherAge ofAnt Man and the WaspProblem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

            <p>Bottom Line: The film will bring back the magic for your t(w)een, who was a fan of the original. But, it could be too intense for preschoolers. There are some spoilers below in the full review. Full Review: While it had some great songs, and I thought better instrumental music, I still like the music from the original better. The reprise of "Into the Unknown" at the end of the movie is sung by Panic! At the Disco - clearly meant to appeal to the original Frozen fans, who are now tweens and teens.</p>

The coal rollers target eco-friendly cars, the Prius in particular, assuming that the drivers of such cars are liberal-leaning and are therefore likely to be most offended. On public roads, this hobby is illegal, because a truck emitting that much smoke violates the Clean Air Act. </p>

The Natrium design represents the future of advanced nuclear reactor technology and is well-suited to provide clean and efficient power to communities across the United States, including the Mountain West. </p>

                        This book is all about studying for an AP test, physics. As you study, you look back on how you could have just picked AP Psychology like a normal, sane human being, but instead decided you want to know about electrons going through solid objects, and you look outside and see your friends having fun, and you wonder how it all went away. great book! 10/10.

                        This book is literally bad. This is not opinion, but 100 percent objective. Even if your IQ is 188789 you wont be able to remember every single egyptian pharaoh that ever lived, and Hammurabi's entire code of laws, plus the name of every soldier that fought in the civil war, and events that happened in alternate timelines. Why in the world would you pick this class. 9/10 not bad.
